### main

my main focus on this assignment was to make the data accessible and easy to find
mapin the data mada it much easier
the main problem with the data was to find a way to match the names of the countrys from both api's
i tried with names and string manipulations but that left me with over 20 unmatched results from all regions
finally i found that the best way to match the two api's was with tld/code(something that i should have thought about during the psaudo code)
then i was left with only three contries left
two i matched manualy and one i deleted

## await

i found it hard to work with api's and asynchronous js
i'm still fetching the data each time the chart changes

## bugs

1. still slow on loading becuse a lot of calls to the api's
2. the chart is not responsive and is with fixed hight and width
3. not a real bug but the "Who Lives Here" region doesnt have almost any data but i'm an equal opportunity developer and it made me laugh so...(:
