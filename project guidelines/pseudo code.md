1. Add more features. You can do much more with this API
2. Make it look pretty
3. Tweak the performance. Maybe local storage can help us here
4. Create a spinner when the data is loading.
5. Disable the buttons when you send an api request. Now what happens is you can click numerous of times on a button and it will send numerous times an api request. But we really only need one.
